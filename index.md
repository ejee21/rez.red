My name is Elijah. I work in offensive security with a focus on red team operations.  
I started out as a penetration tester, gaining experience in network, application, and social engineering engagements.  
Currently, I’m a Red Team Analyst, responsible for simulating real-world adversaries to test and improve organizational defenses.  

This site will serve as a place to share write-ups, notes, and resources from my work and research.
