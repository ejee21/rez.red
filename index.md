I’m Elijah, an offensive security professional specializing in red team operations and adversary emulation.  
I focus on identifying and exploiting weaknesses in networks, applications, and people, and using those findings to improve security posture.

I’m a recent college graduate with hands-on experience in penetration testing, network exploitation, web application testing, and social engineering.  
Current areas of study include Python development, exploit development, and internal network penetration testing.

My skillset includes Active Directory exploitation, privilege escalation, phishing, defensive evasion, and custom tooling for reconnaissance and enumeration.  
I regularly compete in Capture the Flag competitions, focusing on realistic attack paths and post-exploitation scenarios.

I am currently preparing for the OSCP and CPTS certifications to strengthen my capabilities in advanced offensive security operations.

The purpose of this site is to serve as a central place for my blog posts, research notes, and shared information related to offensive security.
